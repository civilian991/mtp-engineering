## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Admin login not working
**Solution**: Ensure the admin_users table was created and has a user. Run migrations and create admin script.

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution**: Configure Supabase Storage buckets and update environment variables.

### Issue: Emails not sending
**Solution**: Configure SMTP variables or use a service like SendGrid/Resend.

### Issue: Database connection errors
**Solution**: Verify Supabase URL and anon key in environment variables.

## Production Commands

```bash
# Start production server
npm start

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Support & Maintenance

For updates and maintenance:
1. Always backup database before updates
2. Test updates in staging environment
3. Run migrations incrementally
4. Monitor error logs after deployment

## Final Notes

- The project uses simplified authentication for initial deployment
- After deployment, run migrations to enable full authentication
- Update types with `npx supabase gen types typescript`
- Consider implementing incremental static regeneration (ISR) for better performance
